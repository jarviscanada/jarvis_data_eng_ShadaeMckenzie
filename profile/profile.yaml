summary: I am Shadae and I've worked as a Risk Officer at Sagicor Life Jamaica. I have some background in data and business analysis with a post graduate certificate in Business Analytics. What really got me into the field, though, was the internship Idid at National Commercial Bank. Here, I worked with the Analytics team to provide insights for business opportunities. Throughout my career, I've noticed that I've always been good with numbers and handling data. For example, while at Sagicor Life Jamaica, I created new insurance products for groups under 30 lives by using data mining and analysis. The resulting products allowed for automatic assignment of insurance plans to smaller groups which provided more time and attention to be allocated to larger premium generating groups.I am passionate about data/business analytics because it helps a business to optimize its performance, maximize profit and make more strategically-guided decisions. Also, I have presentation and documentation skills, along with experience with RDBMS/SQL fundamentals and data analytics tools such as Python and R, which would make me a great fit for a data/business analyst role.

    description: "Recorded hardware specification of each node into a database so that servers can be managed. Also, monitored node resources usage in real time. All data collected was stored in a RDBMS database for the Linux Cluster Administration to generate reports for future resource planning purposes such as remove or add servers. The project was implemented using Linux command lines, bash scripts, postgreSQL and docker. The MVP was test on a single machine, where the functionalities for bash scripts were verified manually and query results were verified against test data for SQL scripts. The agent program was scheduled using crontab, source code was managed by GitHub and the database was provisioned with docker."
